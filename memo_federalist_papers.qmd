## What to hand in

Students should produce a very short report/executive summary that quickly outlines what they did and their results with a comparison of their results to the conclusions of Mosteller and Wallace. The short report/executive summary should be submitted through canvas. **Your report should include a link to the associated GitHub repo.** As always, all code should be well documented and in the associated GitHub repo so we can review/replicate your analytic work.
