### The Federalist Papers

The Federalist Papers comprise 85 articles published under the pseudonym "Publius in New York newspapers between 1787 and 1788, written to convince residents to ratify the Constitution. John Jay wrote 5 papers, while Alexander Hamilton and James Madison wrote the remaining 80.  Between the last two authors there are conflicting accounts of which author wrote which paper. Most sources agree on the authorships of 65 papers (51 by Hamilton and 14 by Madison), but 15 papers are in dispute.

In one of the earliest examples of statistical text analysis, F. Mosteller
and D. L. Wallace used a form of Naive Bayes classification to identify
the authorships of the 15 disputed papers, finding strong evidence that
Madison was the author of all of the disputed papers.
