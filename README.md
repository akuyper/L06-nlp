## Overview

This is a **BONUS** lab and is not required. There are two exercises worth 5 lab points each. Students can opt to do one for 5 lab points or decide to do both for 10 lab points. Partial submission of a single exercise will not be considered for points. That is, students must submit a complete response/solution for us to consider the submission for bonus points.

The main goal of this lab is to perform supervised machine learning with text analysis. Student should use the techniques provided in [Supervised Machine Learning for Text Analysis in R](https://smltar.com/). Chapters 1-5 provide a very good introduction to natural language processing (NLP) while 6 and 7 cover how to use NLP in a machine learning process. These chapters will be particularly useful for completing these exercises. 

## Instructions

After creating a github repo and connecting it to RStudio, students should work through the instructions provided in `LO4_nlp.html`. Students will have to setup a reasonable organizational structure and necessary scripts to complete their work.

Students will need to submit their rendered html file(s) which should contain a link to their GitHub repo.
