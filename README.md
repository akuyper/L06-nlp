## Overview

This is a **BONUS** lab and is not required. There are two exercises worth 10 lab points each. Students can opt to do one for 10 lab points or decide to do both for 20 lab points. Partial submission of a single exercise will not be considered for points. That is, students must submit a complete response/solution for us to consider the submission for bonus points.

The main goal of this lab is to perform supervised machine learning with text analysis. Student should use the techniques provided in [Supervised Machine Learning for Text Analysis in R](https://smltar.com/). Chapters 1-5 provide a very good introduction to natural language processing (NLP) while 6 and 7 cover how to implement use NLP in a machine learning process. These chapters will be particularly useful for completing these exercises.
